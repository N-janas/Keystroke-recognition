# Keystroke-recognition
This project is about testing **SVM KNN** and also **ANN** algorithms with keystroke dynamics data, which was provided by custom made software.
The raw data is processed into **csv** format *(results.csv)* thanks to `converter_to_datasheet.py` script.

Python code in `Keystroke_recognition.ipynb` preprocess mentioned data and evaluates algorithms in:
  - classification
  - anomaly detection 


### Data
Each of the subjects was asked to type certain password-like text exactly **100 times** and their timings were recorded.
After that the subjects sent raw data files to be used in this project.
